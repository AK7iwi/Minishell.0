cd 
pwd
export
env
unset
exit

Search and launch the right executable (based on the PATH variable or using a

g)Handle environment variables ($ followed by a sequence of characters) which
should expand to their values.

Handle $? Which should expand to the exit status of the most recently executed
foreground pipeline

• In interactive mode:
◦ ctrl-C displays a new prompt on a new line.
